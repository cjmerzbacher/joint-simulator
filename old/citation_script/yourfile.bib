@article{covert_integrating_2008,
	abstract = {Motivation: The effort to build a whole-cell model requires the development of new modeling approaches, and in particular, the integration of models for different types of processes, each of which may be best described using different representation. Flux-balance analysis (FBA) has been useful for large-scale analysis of metabolic networks, and methods have been developed to incorporate transcriptional regulation (regulatory FBA, or rFBA). Of current interest is the integration of these approaches with detailed models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs).Results: We developed an approach to modeling the dynamic behavior of metabolic, regulatory and signaling networks by combining FBA with regulatory Boolean logic, and ordinary differential equations. We use this approach (called integrated FBA, or iFBA) to create an integrated model of Escherichia coli which combines a flux-balance-based, central carbon metabolic and transcriptional regulatory model with an ODE-based, detailed model of carbohydrate uptake control. We compare the predicted Escherichia coli wild-type and single gene perturbation phenotypes for diauxic growth on glucose/lactose and glucose/glucose-6-phosphate with that of the individual models. We find that iFBA encapsulates the dynamics of three internal metabolites and three transporters inadequately predicted by rFBA. Furthermore, we find that iFBA predicts different and more accurate phenotypes than the ODE model for 85 of 334 single gene perturbation simulations, as well for the wild-type simulations. We conclude that iFBA is a significant improvement over the individual rFBA and ODE modeling paradigms.Availability: All MATLAB files used in this study are available at http://www.simtk.org/home/ifba/.Contact:  covert@stanford.eduSupplementary information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{lee_dynamic_2008,
	abstract = {Extracellular cues affect signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes to elicit cellular responses. Although intracellular signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks are highly integrated, previous analyses have largely focused on independent processes (e.g., metabolism) without considering the interplay that exists among them. However, there is evidence that many diseases arise from multifunctional components with roles throughout signaling, metabolic, and regulatory networks. Therefore, in this study, we propose a flux balance analysis (FBA)--based strategy, referred to as integrated dynamic FBA (idFBA), that dynamically simulates cellular phenotypes arising from integrated networks. The idFBA framework requires an integrated stoichiometric reconstruction of signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes. It assumes quasi-steady-state conditions for ``fast'' reactions and incorporates ``slow'' reactions into the stoichiometric formalism in a time-delayed manner. To assess the efficacy of idFBA, we developed a prototypic integrated system comprising signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes with network features characteristic of actual systems and incorporating kinetic parameters based on typical time scales observed in literature. idFBA was applied to the prototypic system, which was evaluated for different environments and gene regulatory rules. In addition, we applied the idFBA framework in a similar manner to a representative module of the single-cell eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ultimately, idFBA facilitated quantitative, dynamic analysis of systemic effects of extracellular cues on cellular phenotypes and generated comparable time-course predictions when contrasted with an equivalent kinetic model. Since idFBA solves a linear programming problem and does not require an exhaustive list of detailed kinetic parameters, it may be efficiently scaled to integrated intracellular systems that incorporate signaling, metabolic, and regulatory processes at the genome scale, such as the S. cerevisiae system presented here.},

@article{reimers_cellular_2017,
	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are an integral part of Earth's biogeochemical cycles and a promising resource for the synthesis of renewable bioproducts from atmospheric CO2. Growth and metabolism of cyanobacteria are inherently tied to the diurnal rhythm of light availability. As yet, however, insight into the stoichiometric and energetic constraints of cyanobacterial diurnal growth is limited. Here, we develop a computational framework to investigate the optimal allocation of cellular resources during diurnal phototrophic growth using a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. We formulate phototrophic growth as an autocatalytic process and solve the resulting time-dependent resource allocation problem using constraint-based analysis. Based on a narrow and well-defined set of parameters, our approach results in an ab initio prediction of growth properties over a full diurnal cycle. The computational model allows us to study the optimality of metabolite partitioning during diurnal growth. The cyclic pattern of glycogen accumulation, an emergent property of the model, has timing characteristics that are in qualitative agreement with experimental findings. The approach presented here provides insight into the time-dependent resource allocation problem of phototrophic diurnal growth and may serve as a general framework to assess the optimality of metabolic strategies that evolved in phototrophic organisms under diurnal conditions.},

@article{Waldherr2015,
	abstract = {The regulation of metabolic activity by tuning enzyme expression levels is crucial to sustain cellular growth in changing environments. Metabolic networks are often studied at steady state using constraint-based models and optimization techniques. However, metabolic adaptations driven by changes in gene expression cannot be analyzed by steady state models, as these do not account for temporal changes in biomass composition.Here we present a dynamic optimization framework that integrates the metabolic network with the dynamics of biomass production and composition. An approximation by a timescale separation leads to a coupled model of quasi-steady state constraints on the metabolic reactions, and differential equations for the substrate concentrations and biomass composition. We propose a dynamic optimization approach to determine reaction fluxes for this model, explicitly taking into account enzyme production costs and enzymatic capacity. In contrast to the established dynamic flux balance analysis, our approach allows predicting dynamic changes in both the metabolic fluxes and the biomass composition during metabolic adaptations. Discretization of the optimization problems leads to a linear program that can be efficiently solved.We applied our algorithm in two case studies: a minimal nutrient uptake network, and an abstraction of core metabolic processes in bacteria. In the minimal model, we show that the optimized uptake rates reproduce the empirical Monod growth for bacterial cultures. For the network of core metabolic processes, the dynamic optimization algorithm predicted commonly observed metabolic adaptations, such as a diauxic switch with a preference ranking for different nutrients, re-utilization of waste products after depletion of the original substrate, and metabolic adaptation to an impending nutrient depletion. These examples illustrate how dynamic adaptations of enzyme expression can be predicted solely from an optimization principle.},

@article{Oyarzun2011b,
	abstract = {This note addresses the optimal control of non-linear metabolic networks by means of time-dependent enzyme synthesis rates. The authors consider networks with general topologies described by a control-affine dynamical system coupled with a linear model for enzyme synthesis and degradation. The problem formulation accounts for transitions between two metabolic equilibria, which typically arise in metabolic adaptations to environmental changes, and the minimisation of a quadratic functional that weights the cost/benefit relation between the transcriptional effort required for enzyme synthesis and the transition to the new phenotype. Using a linear time-variant approximation of the non-linear dynamics, the problem is recast as a sequence of linear-quadratic problems, the solution of which involves a sequence of differential Lyapunov equations. The authors provide conditions for convergence to an approximate solution of the original problem, which are naturally satisfied by a wide class of models for saturable enzyme kinetics. As a case study the authors use the method to examine the robustness of an optimal just-in-time gene expression pattern with respect to heterogeneity in the biosynthetic costs of individual proteins.},

	abstract = {Dynamic pathway engineering aims to build metabolic production systems embedded with intracellular control mechanisms for improved performance. These control systems enable host cells to self-regulate the temporal activity of a production pathway in response to perturbations, using a combination of biosensors and feedback circuits for controlling expression of heterologous enzymes. Pathway design, however, requires assembling together multiple biological parts into suitable circuit architectures, as well as careful calibration of the function of each component. This results in a large design space that is costly to navigate through experimentation alone. Methods from artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are gaining increasing attention as tools to accelerate the design cycle, owing to their ability to identify hidden patterns in data and rapidly screen through large collections of designs. In this review, we discuss recent developments in the application of machine learning methods to the design of dynamic pathways and their components. We cover recent successes and offer perspectives for future developments in the field. The integration of AI into metabolic engineering pipelines offers great opportunities to streamline design and discover control systems for improved production of high-value chemicals.},

Using the lac system in Escherichia coli as a model system, we built promoter libraries with variable operator sites that reveal interdependencies between biosensor dynamic range and response threshold. We developed a phenomenological theory to quantify such design constraints in biosensors with various architectures and tunable parameters. Our theory reveals a maximal achievable dynamic range and exposes tunable parameters for orthogonal control of dynamic range and response threshold. Our work sheds light on fundamental limits of synthetic biology designs and provides quantitative guidelines for biosensor design in applications such as dynamic pathway control, strain optimization, and real-time monitoring of metabolism.},

Predicting the interaction landscape remains a challenge for systems biology and new research tools allowing simple and rapid mapping of sequence to function are desirable. Here, we describe CRI-SPA, a method allowing the transfer of chromosomal genetic features from a CRI-SPA Donor strain to arrayed strains in large libraries of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. CRI-SPA is based on mating, CRISPR-Cas9-induced gene conversion, and Selective Ploidy Ablation. CRI-SPA can be massively parallelized with automation and can be executed within a week. We demonstrate the power of CRI-SPA by transferring four genes that enable betaxanthin production into each strain of the yeast knockout collection (≈4800 strains). Using this setup, we show that CRI-SPA is highly efficient and reproducible, and even allows marker-free transfer of genetic features. Moreover, we validate a set of CRI-SPA hits by showing that their phenotypes correlate strongly with the phenotypes of the corresponding mutant strains recreated by reverse genetic engineering. Hence, our results provide a genome-wide overview of the genetic requirements for betaxanthin production. We envision that the simplicity, speed, and reliability offered by CRI-SPA will make it a versatile tool to forward systems-level understanding of biological processes.},

@article{Gorochowski2016,
	abstract = {Cells contain a finite set of resources that must be distributed across many processes to ensure survival. Among them, the largest proportion of cellular resources is dedicated to protein translation. Synthetic biology often exploits these resources in executing orthogonal genetic circuits, yet the burden this places on the cell is rarely considered. Here, we develop a minimal model of ribosome allocation dynamics capturing the demands on translation when expressing a synthetic construct together with endogenous genes required for the maintenance of cell physiology. Critically, it contains three key variables related to design parameters of the synthetic construct covering transcript abundance, translation initiation rate, and elongation time. We show that model-predicted changes in ribosome allocation closely match experimental shifts in synthetic protein expression rate and cellular growth. Intriguingly, the model is also able to accurately infer transcript levels and translation times after further exposure to additional ambient stress. Our results demonstrate that a simple model of resource allocation faithfully captures the redistribution of protein synthesis resources when faced with the burden of synthetic gene expression and environmental stress. The tractable nature of the model makes it a versatile tool for exploring the guiding principles of efficient heterologous expression and the indirect interactions that can arise between synthetic circuits and their host chassis because of competition for shared translational resources.},

@article{melendez-alvarez_emergent_2021,
	abstract = {Growth feedback, the inherent coupling between the synthetic gene circuit and the host cell growth, could significantly change the circuit behaviors. Previously, a diverse array of emergent behaviors, such as growth bistability, enhanced ultrasensitivity, and topology-dependent memory loss, were reported to be induced by growth feedback. However, the influence of the growth feedback on the circuit functions remains underexplored. Here, we reported an unexpected damped oscillatory behavior of a self-activation gene circuit induced by nutrient-modulating growth feedback. Specifically, after dilution of the activated self-activation switch into the fresh medium with moderate nutrients, its gene expression first decreases as the cell grows and then shows a significant overshoot before it reaches the steady state, leading to damped oscillation dynamics. Fitting the data with a coarse-grained model suggests a nonmonotonic growth-rate regulation on gene production rate. The underlying mechanism of the oscillation was demonstrated by a molecular mathematical model, which includes the ribosome allocation toward gene production, cell growth, and cell maintenance. Interestingly, the model predicted a counterintuitive dependence of oscillation amplitude on the nutrition level, where the highest peak was found in the medium with moderate nutrients, but was not observed in rich nutrients. We experimentally verified this prediction by tuning the nutrient level in the culture medium. We did not observe significant oscillatory behavior for the toggle switch, suggesting that the emergence of damped oscillatory behavior depends on circuit network topology. Our results demonstrated a new nonlinear emergent behavior mediated by growth feedback, which depends on the ribosome allocation between gene circuit and cell growth.},

	abstract = {One fundamental challenge in synthetic biology is the lack of quantitative tools that accurately describe and predict the behaviours of engineered gene circuits. This challenge arises from multiple factors, among which the complex interdependence of circuits and their host is a leading cause. Here we present a gene circuit modelling framework that explicitly integrates circuit behaviours with host physiology through bidirectional circuit-host coupling. The framework consists of a coarse-grained but mechanistic description of host physiology that involves dynamic resource partitioning, multilayered circuit-host coupling including both generic and system-specific interactions, and a detailed kinetic module of exogenous circuits. We showed that, following training, the framework was able to capture and predict a large set of experimental data concerning the host and its foreign gene overexpression. To demonstrate its utility, we applied the framework to examine a growth-modulating feedback circuit whose dynamics is qualitatively altered by circuit-host interactions. Using an extended version of the framework, we further systematically revealed the behaviours of a toggle switch across scales from single-cell dynamics to population structure and to spatial ecology. This work advances our quantitative understanding of gene circuit behaviours and also benefits the rational design of synthetic gene networks.},

In this work, the computational OptKnock framework is introduced for suggesting gene deletion strategies leading to the over-production of chemicals or biochemicals in E. coli. This is accomplished by ensuring that a drain towards growth resources (i.e., carbon, redox potential, and energy) must be accompanied, due to stoichiometry, by the production of a desired product. Computational results for gene deletions for succinate, lactate, and 1,3-propanediol (PDO) production are in good agreement with mutant strains published in the literature. While some of the suggested deletion strategies are straightforward and involve eliminating competing reaction pathways, many others suggest complex and nonintuitive mechanisms of compensating for the removed functionalities. Finally, the OptKnock procedure, by coupling biomass formation with chemical production, hints at a growth selection/adaptation system for indirectly evolving overproducing mutants. {\copyright} 2003 Wiley Periodicals.},

@article{ranganathan_optforce_2010,
	abstract = {Computational procedures for predicting metabolic interventions leading to the overproduction of biochemicals in microbial strains are widely in use. However, these methods rely on surrogate biological objectives (e.g., maximize growth rate or minimize metabolic adjustments) and do not make use of flux measurements often available for the wild-type strain. In this work, we introduce the OptForce procedure that identifies all possible engineering interventions by classifying reactions in the metabolic model depending upon whether their flux values must increase, decrease or become equal to zero to meet a pre-specified overproduction target. We hierarchically apply this classification rule for pairs, triples, quadruples, etc. of reactions. This leads to the identification of a sufficient and non-redundant set of fluxes that must change (i.e., MUST set) to meet a pre-specified overproduction target. Starting with this set we subsequently extract a minimal set of fluxes that must actively be forced through genetic manipulations (i.e., FORCE set) to ensure that all fluxes in the network are consistent with the overproduction objective. We demonstrate our OptForce framework for succinate production in Escherichia coli using the most recent in silico E. coli model, iAF1260. The method not only recapitulates existing engineering strategies but also reveals non-intuitive ones that boost succinate production by performing coordinated changes on pathways distant from the last steps of succinate synthesis.},

	abstract = {Introduction of synthetic circuits into microbes creates competition between circuit and host genes for shared cellular resources, such as ribosomes. This can lead to the emergence of unwanted coupling between the expression of different circuit genes, complicating the design process and potentially leading to circuit failure. By expressing a synthetic 16S rRNA with altered specificity, we can partition the ribosome pool into host-specific and circuit-specific activities. We show mathematically and experimentally that the effects of resource competition can be alleviated by targeting genes to different ribosomal pools. This division of labour can be used to increase flux through a metabolic pathway. We develop a model of cell physiology which is able to capture these observations and use it to design a dynamic resource allocation controller. When implemented, this controller acts to decouple genes by increasing orthogonal ribosome production as the demand for translational resources by a synthetic circuit increases.},

	abstract = {Metabolism governs cell performance in biomanufacturing, as it fuels growth and productivity. However, even in well-controlled culture systems, metabolism is dynamic, with shifting objectives and resources, thus limiting the predictive capability of mechanistic models for process design and optimization. Here, we present Cellular Objectives and State Modulation In bioreaCtors (COSMIC)-dFBA, a hybrid multi-scale modeling paradigm that accurately predicts cell density, antibody titer, and bioreactor metabolite concentration profiles. Using machine-learning, COSMIC-dFBA decomposes the instantaneous metabolite uptake and secretion rates in a bioreactor into weighted contributions from each cell state (growth or antibody-producing state) and integrates these with a genome-scale metabolic model. A major strength of COSMIC-dFBA is that it can be parameterized with only metabolite concentrations from spent media, although constraining the metabolic model with other omics data can further improve its capabilities. Using COSMIC-dFBA, we can predict the final cell density and antibody titer to within 10\% of the measured data, and compared to a standard dFBA model, we found the framework showed a 90\% and 72\% improvement in cell density and antibody titer prediction, respectively. Thus, we demonstrate our hybrid modeling framework effectively captures cellular metabolism and expands the applicability of dFBA to model the dynamic conditions in a bioreactor.},

Individual stress responses have been quantified by E. coli metabolism and expression (ME) models under thermal, oxidative and acid stress, respectively.

Here, we present StressME: the unified stress response model of E. coli combining thermal (FoldME), oxidative (OxidizeME) and acid (AcidifyME) stress responses. StressME is the most up to date ME model for E. coli and it reproduces all published single-stress ME models. Additionally, it includes refined rate constants to improve prediction accuracy for wild-type and stress-evolved strains. StressME revealed certain optimal proteome allocation strategies associated with cross-stress and cross-talk responses. These stress-optimal proteomes were shaped by trade-offs between protective vs. metabolic enzymes; cytoplasmic vs. periplasmic chaperones; and expression of stress-specific proteins. As StressME is tuned to compute metabolic and gene expression responses under mild acid, oxidative, and thermal stresses, it is useful for engineering and health applications.
